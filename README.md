# Spring 2024 Statistics Final Project
For my final project, I looked at anonymized dining hall swipe data from the 2011-2012 Bowdoin academic year. Goals of this project were:
* Identify trends in continuous time series swipe data
* Compare Moulton vs Thorne swipe data
* Identifying social networks through a novel characterization of swipe-based networking
* Identifying social trends based on the networks generated

Potential further applications of this data IF Bowdoin would just have stored their menu data in a historical archive (which is really not that difficult!):
* Quantifying the "above replacement" value of menu items
* Determining which menu items to phase out due to lack of interest from student body
* Predicting length of dining hall lines/wait time for individual menu items/entire menus
* Generating predictions of food consumption
* Creation of an algorithm to "balance" menus (e.g., ensure optimal length of lines at each dining hall by matching equally rated menus to each other)
